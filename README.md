# AES-128-Hardware-accelerator (Work in progress)

This project implements an RTL-level AES-128 encryption engine using Verilog.
Current progress includes implementation of core cryptographic modules and initial verification setup.

Implemented modules:

* Key Expansion
* SubBytes
* Partial encryption round

Work in progress:

* FSM controller
* Full round integration
* Testbench validation

Goal:
To design a complete hardware accelerator for AES encryption optimized for performance and modularity.
