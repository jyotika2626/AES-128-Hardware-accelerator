# AES-128 Hardware Accelerator (Work in Progress)

This project focuses on designing an RTL-based AES-128 encryption hardware accelerator using Verilog HDL. The goal is to develop a modular and synthesizable architecture capable of efficient cryptographic processing.

## Project Overview

AES is a widely used symmetric encryption standard. This project aims to implement the AES encryption pipeline at hardware level using structured modules and control logic.

## Planned Architecture Modules

* Key Expansion Unit
* SubBytes Transformation
* ShiftRows Operation
* MixColumns Operation
* Round Control FSM
* Top-Level Integration

## Current Status

Architecture design and module planning completed. Implementation and verification are currently in progress.

## Objective

To build a high-performance cryptographic accelerator suitable for FPGA or ASIC implementation and gain hands-on experience in RTL design and hardware optimization.

This project is actively under process.
